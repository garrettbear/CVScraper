# CVScraper
Scrape product names to use on another project for fun.

If you're looking for a web scraper, this is not the place you will want to look.

The following code seen here was used for a quick demo to get Product Names. Functionality can be built out to work recursively, but honestly this was just to get a few hundred product names. If you are looking for product names, just look at the results.json file.
